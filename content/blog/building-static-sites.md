# Building Static Sites with SSG

Static Site Generation (SSG) is experiencing a renaissance. Let's explore why.

## What is SSG?

SSG pre-renders pages at build time, creating static HTML files that can be served incredibly fast.

## Benefits of SSG

### Performance
Static files are blazingly fast. No server-side rendering overhead, no database queries per request.

### Security
With no server-side code execution, the attack surface is minimal.

### Scalability
Static files can be served from a CDN, handling massive traffic with ease.

### Cost
Hosting static files is cheap or even free with services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

## When to Use SSG

- Content-focused websites (blogs, documentation)
- Marketing sites
- Portfolios
- Any site where content doesn't change per-user

## The Modern Stack

Tools like Nuxt, Next.js, and Astro make SSG powerful and developer-friendly, combining the benefits of static sites with modern frameworks.

Static doesn't mean simple anymore - it means fast, secure, and scalable!
